Create a Feelings Thermometer for children with ADHD (Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder), using Augmented Reality (AR) for Webcam. The goal is to help children to identify healthy behaviors for emotional control. The Feelings Thermometer is a visual tool that helps children measure how they are doing emotionally and what steps they can take to shift their mood when things are getting tough.
